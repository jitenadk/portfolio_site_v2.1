## Project Overview

CVEMap is a network vulnerability scanner that continuously monitors devices on your network for potential security issues. It cross-references discovered vulnerabilities with the latest CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) database to provide up-to-date security information.

## Key Features

- **Automated Scanning**: Periodically scans all devices on the network without manual intervention
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously watches for new devices and changes in network topology
- **CVE Database Integration**: Cross-references findings with the latest vulnerability database
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports with severity ratings and remediation steps
- **Low Resource Footprint**: Designed to run efficiently on modest hardware

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The tool is built with a modular architecture consisting of three main components:

1. **Scanner Module**: Handles network discovery and port scanning
2. **Analysis Engine**: Processes scan results and identifies vulnerabilities
3. **Reporting System**: Generates user-friendly reports and alerts

### Technologies Used

- Python for core functionality and business logic
- SQLite for local data storage and caching
- Nmap integration for comprehensive network scanning
- Flask for the web interface (optional component)

## Installation Guide

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jitendotexe/CVEMap.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure settings
cp config.example.yml config.yml

# Run the scanner
python cvemap.py --scan
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Network Scan

```bash
python cvemap.py --scan --network 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Continuous Monitoring

```bash
python cvemap.py --monitor --interval 30
```

## Future Development

Planned features for upcoming releases:

- Integration with threat intelligence feeds
- Automated remediation suggestions
- Enhanced visualization of network topology
- Mobile application for alerts and monitoring

## Conclusion

CVEMap provides a robust solution for network vulnerability assessment with minimal setup. By continuously monitoring your network, it helps maintain a strong security posture against emerging threats.
