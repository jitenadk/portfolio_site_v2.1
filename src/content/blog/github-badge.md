### üßä Arctic Code Vault Contributor
![Arctic Code Vault Badge](/img/blog/github-achivement/2020ArcticCodeVaultBadge.png)

**Description**: Awarded for contributing code to repositories in the 2020 GitHub Archive Program. This historic achievement recognizes those who contributed to repositories that were preserved in the Arctic Code Vault.

**How it Was Earned**:
- This was a special achievement for contributors to repositories archived in the GitHub Arctic Code Vault on July 16, 2020
- Contributions had to be made before February 2, 2020, to repositories that were included in the Arctic Code Vault program
- The Arctic Code Vault is a data repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive, a very-long-term archival facility in Svalbard, Norway

**Historical Context**:
The GitHub Archive Program is an initiative to preserve open source software for future generations. The Arctic Code Vault is part of this program, where GitHub took a snapshot of all active public repositories on February 2, 2020, and stored them on film reels designed to last for 1,000 years. The achievement recognizes developers whose code was included in this historic preservation effort.

**Note**: It's no longer possible to earn this achievement unless GitHub runs a similar program in the future. If you contributed to popular open-source projects before February 2020, check your profile to see if you have it.

### üöÅ Mars 2020 Helicopter Contributor
![Mars Helicopter Badge](/img/blog/github-achivement/Mars2020ContributorBadge.png)

**Description**: Awarded for contributing to repositories used in the Mars 2020 Helicopter Mission. This prestigious achievement recognizes developers whose code helped power the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars.

**How it Was Earned**:
- This special achievement was given to developers who contributed to open-source libraries used in the Mars Ingenuity Helicopter
- GitHub identified contributors to specific repositories and dependencies that were used in the helicopter's software
- The badge was awarded in April 2021 to coincide with the first flight of Ingenuity on Mars

**Historical Context**:
The Mars Ingenuity Helicopter made history as the first aircraft to achieve powered, controlled flight on another planet. Its software relied on numerous open-source projects and libraries. GitHub collaborated with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to identify the open-source projects that contributed to the mission's success and recognized those contributors with this special badge.

**Note**: Like the Arctic Code Vault badge, this is a historical achievement that cannot be earned now. You can learn more about which repositories were included on the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2021-04-19-open-source-goes-to-mars/).

### üßô Open Sourcerer
![Open Sourcerer Badge](/img/blog/github-achivement/OpenSourcerer.png)

1. Use GitHub's Explore page or sites like [goodfirstissue.dev](https://goodfirstissue.dev) to find projects needing help
2. Read the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file to understand their contribution guidelines
3. Start with small contributions like fixing typos or improving documentation
4. As you gain confidence, tackle more complex issues
5. Make sure to contribute to different repositories, as the achievement counts unique repositories, not the number of contributions

**Pro Tip**: Join Hacktoberfest (October) or similar events to find welcoming repositories. Many projects tag issues specifically for new contributors during these events.

### üîç Public Sponsor
