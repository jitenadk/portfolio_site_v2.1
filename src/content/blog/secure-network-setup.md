## Introduction

A secure home network is the first line of defense against cyber threats. In this post, we'll explore how to set up a robust and secure network for your home.

## Router Configuration

Start by securing your router:

1. Change default login credentials
2. Enable WPA3 encryption
3. Disable WPS
4. Update firmware regularly

## Setting Up VLANs

Network segmentation is crucial for security. I recommend creating at least three VLANs:

- Main network for trusted devices
- IoT network for smart home devices
- Guest network for visitors

## Firewall Rules

Implement strict firewall rules to control traffic between VLANs. This prevents compromised devices from affecting your entire network.

## Conclusion

Following these steps will significantly improve your home network security. In my next post, I'll cover advanced monitoring techniques.
